# =============================================================================
# Timeout Policies
# =============================================================================
# Named timeout values for consistent configuration across routes.
# Reference these in domain routes: timeout: short (uses 5s)
#
# Timeout guidelines:
#   - short:   Health checks, quick lookups, cache hits
#   - medium:  API calls, database queries
#   - default: General web requests
#   - long:    File uploads, report generation
#   - streaming: Long-lived connections (WebSocket, SSE)

timeouts:
  # Standard timeout for most requests
  default: 60s

  # Quick operations - fail fast if slow
  short: 5s

  # Moderate operations - API calls with some processing
  medium: 30s

  # Long operations - file uploads, complex queries
  long: 120s

  # Streaming/WebSocket connections (uncomment if needed)
  # streaming: 3600s  # 1 hour

  # Ultra-short for health checks (uncomment if needed)
  # health: 1s
